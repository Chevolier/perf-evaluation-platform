# Perf Eval Platform – Implementation & Validation Log

This document captures the end-to-end work completed on the Perf Evaluation Platform over the recent engineering cycle, from the initial Bedrock fixes through the latest external deployment streaming support. It serves as a single source of truth for what changed, why it changed, and how each capability was validated.

---

## 1. Bedrock Reliability & Streaming (Phase 1)

### Key Changes
- **Corrected model metadata** to use US inference profile ARNs for Claude models and enforced `us-east-1` when building Bedrock sessions.
- **Refreshed boto3 sessions** per request to avoid stale credential reuse and added richer logging around STS identity.
- **Implemented SSE streaming** end-to-end for Bedrock responses:
  - `_process_bedrock_model` now prefers `invoke_model_with_response_stream`.
  - Multi-model inference uses SSE heartbeat events to keep connections alive.
- **Frontend streaming overhaul**:
  - Replaced static loading state with incremental chunk rendering.
  - Added blinking cursor and comprehension-friendly status messaging.
  - Forced re-renders with `lastUpdated` timestamps to sidestep React batching.
- **Diagnostic tooling**: Verified with AWS CLI, `curl` streaming tests, and console logging across backend/frontend.

### Validation
| Area | Scenario | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AWS credentials | `aws sts get-caller-identity` via boto3 | ✅ Logged identity ARN successfully |
| Streaming | `curl -N http://localhost:5000/api/multi-inference` | ✅ SSE chunks arrive progressively |
| UI rendering | Manual tests on Playground page | ✅ Cursor blinks, text builds token-by-token |
| Error handling | Simulated AccessDeniedException | ✅ User-friendly messaging exposed |

---

## 2. EMD Streaming & Stress-Test Alignment (Phase 2)

### Key Changes
- **EMD invocation pipeline** updated to prefer OpenAI-compatible endpoints exposed by the Elastic Model Deployer.
  - `_process_emd_model` resolves endpoints via `resolve_deployment_api_url` and falls back to legacy `invoke_endpoint` when streaming fails.
  - Manual API handler promotes streaming chunks and exposes raw responses for debugging.
- **EvalScope stress tests** now reuse the same endpoint resolution, enabling consistent benchmarking and config generation (`eval_config.json`, `performance_metrics.csv`).
- **Model registry** enriched with deployment tags, instance metadata, and logic to recover from stale cache/circuit-breaker scenarios.

### Validation
| Area | Scenario | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Endpoint resolution | `resolve_deployment_api_url` with EMD status payloads | ✅ Extracted chat-completions URLs, including fallback logic |
| Streaming | Playground inference with deployed EMD model | ✅ Token-streaming identical to Bedrock workflow |
| Stress tests | `/api/stress-test/start` (EMD) | ✅ EvalScope run produced metrics & persisted outputs |
| Persistence | Restart backend | ✅ Deployment status cached & reconciled post-restart |

---

## 3. External Deployments (HyperPod / EKS / EC2) (Phase 3)

### Key Changes
- **SQLite persistence layer**
  - Added `deployment_endpoints` table (unique `model_key`, metadata JSON, status) and helper methods (`upsert_deployment_endpoint`, `list_deployment_endpoints`).
- **Model registry extensions**
  - Introduced dynamic `external` category with `always_available` flag.
  - `ModelService` now refreshes external models on every `get_model_list` and offers `register_external_endpoint` for other services.
- **HyperPod integration**
  - After successful InfraForge jobs, `_ingest_job_outputs` gathers SSM parameters, normalizes endpoints, and automatically registers them.
- **Inference & Stress tests**
  - `_process_external_model` delegates to `_process_manual_api`, ensuring SSE streaming for registered endpoints.
  - Stress test service treats external deployments as first-class targets with EvalScope.
- **API Surface**
  - `POST /api/register-deployment-endpoint` allows manual registration of HyperPod/EKS/EC2 (or any OpenAI-compatible) endpoints.
- **Frontend**
  - Model Hub & Playground selectors build categories dynamically and show the new “外部部署” section.
  - Manual “手动输入” remains for ad-hoc endpoints while benefitting from the same streaming pipeline.

### Validation
| Area | Scenario | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Table creation | Backend restart | ✅ `deployment_endpoints` table auto-created |
| Endpoint registration | EKS / EC2 / HyperPod via API | ✅ 201 responses, unique `model_key`s (`ext::...`) |
| Model list | `GET /api/model-list` | ✅ External category present with status + endpoint |
| SSE streaming | Playground inference (registered endpoint) | ✅ Streams via `_process_manual_api` |
| Stress test | Custom API stress run | ✅ EvalScope execution with external endpoint |
| Persistence | Restart backend | ✅ Endpoints persisted and reloaded |
| HyperPod auto ingest | Simulated job result | ✅ Endpoint captured from Parameter Store |
| Frontend | Model Hub cards + Playground selection | ✅ External deployments selectable & stream |

## 4. Documentation & Operational Hygiene
- Added `docs/perf_eval_full_implementation.md` (this file) to record scope & validation.
- Maintained consistent git hygiene: feature work pushed to `yx-test`, obsolete branches deleted.
- Ensured front/back runners (`npm start`, `python run_backend.py`) operate cleanly with the new persistence layer.

---

## 5. Outstanding Opportunities
1. **HyperPod Step Functions integration**: wire the state machine outputs directly into the new registration flow in production.
2. **Auth metadata**: extend endpoint metadata to capture auth mode (API key / IAM / none) for richer validation.
3. **Automated regression tests**: implement pytest coverage for endpoint persistence and SSE streaming across restart cycles.
4. **UI polish**: surface endpoint metadata tooltips (region, instance type) in Model Hub cards for ops visibility.

## Summary
Across these phases we raised Bedrock reliability, gave EMD parity through streaming & EvalScope, and opened the door for any external deployment to plug in with no code changes. The platform now:

- Streams every supported provider (Bedrock, EMD, HyperPod, EKS, EC2, manual URLs) via SSE.
- Persists deployment metadata so restarts do not disrupt operations.
- Offers a unified UI experience where ops can deploy, stream, and benchmark any endpoint.

The `yx-test` branch holds all finalized work and has been validated through manual and scripted testing end-to-end.
